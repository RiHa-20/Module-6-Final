			<p style="font-size:20px"><img src="./images/Awards.jpg" alt="George S Patton's Awards"> George S. Patton spent a year at the Virginia Military Institute and then transferred to the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. He graduated from West Point in 1909 after having to repeat his plebe year because of grade issues. Seeing his first taste of battle in 1915 when Pancho Villa, a Mexican revolutionary, invaded the border town of Columbus, New Mexico. In 1917 when the U.S. entered World War I, Patton was promoted to captain and went over to France. In 1932 Patton graduated with distinction from the Army War College. In April of 1941 he was promoted to temporary major general, then weeks later made commander, of the 2nd Armored Division. In the summer of 1944, Patton's Third Army made a dramatic sweep across northern France and by January 1945 they had reached the Greman frontier. He was removed from his command of the Third Army in October 1945. His last command was of the Fifteenth U.S. Army and on December 9th, 1945, Patton was involved in a low-speed car accident that caused serious head and spine injuries, twelve days later he died. </p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Smith-Patton/Controversies-and-appraisal">For more information on General Patton's military career visit Britannica.com.</a>

			<h4> The strange death of General Patton</h4>
			<p style="font-size:20px"> Patton's death was not one that was expected from the crash he was involved in. Known as "Old Blood and Guts" by his soilders. The only one hurt in this crash was Patton, depite there being several other people in the limousine. Along with him being the only one hurt in the crash. Patton requested a guared to be posted outside of his hospital room despite being the most revered general in Europe. Additionally, after his death there was <b> no autopsy.</b> According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2010/12/19/was-patton-killed/"><u>the NY Post</u></a> "all reports and subsequent investigations of the crash-and there were at least five- have vanished" (Wilcox, 2010). For all these reasons there are many out there that believe that General Patton was murdered for his view on post war policy and that the government is hiding the evidence to prove that Patton was murdered.</p>
